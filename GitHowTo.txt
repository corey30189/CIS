- For example I create a file called "bs.txt"

- open git bash by right clicking in directory and opening bash from there, or cd to it in bash
	
	- create git repo in project directory with:

		- git init
			
	- ensure there is not an existing origin:
			
		- git remote -v

	- if so:
	
		- git remote remove origin		
	
	
	- set up connection to remote repo with:
	
		- git remote add origin http://github.com/jaskamiin/CIS.git

	- pull from the remote:

		- git pull 

	- add file:

		- git add bs.txt

	- commit the file:

		- git commit bs.txt -m "this sure is some flaming bullsh"

	- push the file:

		- git push

-From there you will need to type in your username and password on git 
	
	- make sure you are a contributor - Arielle i think you are not yet
